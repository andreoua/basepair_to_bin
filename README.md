# Matching Base Pairs from a list of research papers to their respective bin locations and filtering for the smallest p-value
A Jupyter notebook used to match a list of research papers, base pairs and an associated p-value to their corresponding bin and filter for the smallest value.

The data used to create the results is not included in this repository but is available in Harvard's Dataverse under [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8CZSMB](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8CZSMB).
